"As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin.

cc Beth PerlmanHOU Subject Consolidated positions Issues To Do list Phillip, Below is the issues to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like Excel. What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project. I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good.

We dont have a single point of contact from the trading group. Weve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders. We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.

I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this project. Itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance priority of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter Subject Westgate Westgate Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investors Alliance.
Investors Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for 2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly 1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12month lease and
1.301.40 psf if leased on a 12month term, but by individual room. This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be 300,000 to secure the land. I will
know more on this question later today. Sincerely, George W. Richards

"Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 4.704.80 for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly 10 to 15 cents lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online EOL, Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms Amerex, APB, and Prebon. Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows 1. The high physical prices on the 26th 27th 4.75,4,80 are much greater than the high financial trades 4.6375,4.665 on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points Socal Northwest is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesnt make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70s and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enrons belief that the trades at 4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Claudia L. Crocker Subject Investment Structure STRUCTURE
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or LLC
general partner. The General Partner owns 1 of the project and carries the
liability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investors do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits
is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS
The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as
high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at
2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000
which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required
of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
spec loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the
builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans
in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for
presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting. BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand. INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating. CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped. PRESELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested. I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. Sincerely, George Richards

of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
spec loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the
builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans
in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for
presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting. BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand. INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating. CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped. PRESELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested. I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. Sincerely, George Richards

To jeff cc Phillip K Allen Subject closing Jeff, ?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the agreement?I find it isnt binding as far as I can determine.? It is too vague and it doesnt sound like anything an attorney or title company would?draft for a real estate closingbut, of course, I could be wrong.? ?
If this?closing is going to take place without this agreement then there is no point in me following up on this?documents validity.? ?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents and see whats there and find out where I am with that and deal with this as best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an exhibit to a recordable document or something a little more exact, or rather?sort of a contract.? This isnt either.? I tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last night but he was out of pocket.? I talked to a crim. atty friend and he said this is out of his area but doesnt sound binding to him.? ?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allens transaction?and take a look at that but as vague and general as this is I doubt that my signature? is even needed to complete this transaction.? I am in after 12 noon if there is any need to contact me regarding the closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself and I dont want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesnt seem to be something required for a closing.? In the event you do need my signature on something like this I would rather have time to have it reviewed before I accept it.

Investment What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans? Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans? Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made? By whom? What type of bank account? Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names? These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me. Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process. Phillip",General Inquiry
"George Richards on 09082000 052149 AM
Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter Subject Westgate ProformaPhillip Allen.xls Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40 per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street
widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of 680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an AD Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at 700,000 for a 50 interest in the
profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
5123381119 or 5123381110. My cell phone is 5127487495 and the fax is
5123381103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Diana Zuniga Subject Sagewood Town Homes I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the 180s, He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a he is selling them during construction and b they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 11641302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be 73.80 psf at 182,000. I thought his
sales price was 187,000. At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for 203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a the rental rate and b the
rentability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation. As for rentability, I believe that we have shown that the
3bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of 680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an AD Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at 700,000 for a 50 interest in the
profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
5123381119 or 5123381110. My cell phone is 5127487495 and the fax is
5123381103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

cc Subject Thoughts on Presentation It is a shame that the CAISO doesnt provide actual generation by unit. The WSCC data, which is dicey and we dont have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. For your purposes the CAISO may suffice. I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation. You are pulling scheduled. If someone doesnt schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that. You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. While they dont split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number. The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually underscheduling depending on price. I think the presentation looks good. It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished. Id like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gasgenerated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption. I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses. If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story. Lets talk.",General Inquiry

cc Subject Transport pl Phillip
Ive noticed one thing on your intramonth transport pl that looks strange to me. Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but Ill point it out and let you decide. Let me know if this is O.K. as is, so Ill know to ignore it in the future. Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and Ill take care of it.. On PGE NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 235,019. If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate plnot change your overall pl. Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal s, paths and pl impacts of each. 139195 From Kingsgate to Malin 182,030 139196 From Kingsgate to PGENTuscarora 4,024 139197 From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin 8,271 231321 From Kingsgate to Malin 38,705 153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield 1,988 Suggested fix Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDPMalin Citygate to GDPKingsgate. Clay Basin storagethis is really a FYI more than anything elseI see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activityone appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. Im not sure of the best way to handle this since we dont really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, heres the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. There may be an operational reason why this occurred that Im not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought Id bring it to your attention just in case theres something you want to do about it.

cc Subject	Re This mornings Commission meeting delayed Phil, I suspect that discussionsnegotiations are taking place behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms, if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers. Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. Hope this info helps. Ray Phillip K 04252001 0228 PM

In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio fixed, indexed, collars.... should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of their PGAs and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management do you have any preference on structure? Are there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Laird",General Inquiry

"If you have any questions, please contact Kristin Walsh at 713 8539510. Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May 8th deadline. Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart. According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis. Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double dip into the fund. Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor. However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. If not, the state may be in breach of contract. Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult. The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion. However, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession. Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB 8X and AB 31X. AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to 10 billion in bonds. This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support. AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts. However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X. Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy. According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund. For instance, Tony Strickland has stated that only 12 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion should be issued. Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday. Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount 4.125 B
Lenders JP Morgan 2.5 B Lehman Brothers 1.0 B Bear Stearns 625 M
Tax Exempt Portion Of the 4.125 B 1.6 B is expected to be taxexempt
Projected Interest Rate Taxable Rate 5.77 TaxExempt Rate 4.77
Current Projected Blended IR 5.38
Maturity Date August 29, 2001
For more details please contact me at 713 8539510 Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes 5 billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority. The 5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the same as the 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward. Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations. Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support. No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power. Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. However, this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor. The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it. The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash. The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount. In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities. If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy. SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",Course Registration

cc Subject Re This mornings Commission meeting delayed Phil, I suspect that discussionsnegotiations are taking place behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms, if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers. Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. Hope this info helps. Ray Phillip K 04252001 0228 PM

cc Tim HeizenraderPDX, Tim BeldenHOU, Matt MotleyPDX, Michael M DriscollPDX, Chris MalloryPDX, Jeff RichterHOU, Robert BadeerHOU, Sean CrandallPDX, Mark FischerPDX, Bill Williams IIIPDX, Diana ScholtesHOU Subject CAISO demand reduction Phillip et al., I have been digging into the answer to your question re demand reduction in the West. Your intuition as to reductions seen so far e.g., March 2001 vs. March 2000 was absolutely correct. At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6. This translates into a reduction of about 1,5001,600 MWa for last month March 2001 as compared with the previous year. Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts. Other forecasters e.g., PIRA are estimating that another 1,2001,300 MWa making total yearonyear reduction 2,7002,800 will come off starting in June. This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. Given that the 6 decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10 relative to last year. This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,3003,500 MWa in JunAug. In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89 of total Calif load, or 3637 of WSCC U.S. summer load. I think it is reasonable to assume that the nonISO portion of Calif i.e., LADWP and IID will see similar reductions in demand. As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years if BPA gets its wish. This figure represents approx 4 of the nonCalif WSCC. Several mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production. I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Califs economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10 reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I think we could easily expect an additional 23 on top of the 4 already realized, or approx 1,0001,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the nonCalif WSCC for this summer. This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,5007,000 MWa when compared with last summer. I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available. Meantime, I hope this helps. Please feel free to call 5034648671 if you have any questions or need any further information.",Course Registration

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently 165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of 94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and TransportationCorpEnron or 7138537060 with any questions.

"I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221d loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows 5 onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2 overhead 4 profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate 219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to 10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services. I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week. Phillip",General Inquiry

Wouldnt fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents power or turbine? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didnt know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 12 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 AC units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up. I am going to call Cary Kipp to

Something that I forgot to ask you. Do you know if Hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks? Also let me know about the parking. The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.

"The agreement looks fine. My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project. Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them 1,300,000? I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of 5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. Phillip",Payment & Fees

I will be in San Marcos and you can reach me on my cell phone 7134104679 or email I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a check and give him the green light to file for replatting. What will change if we want to try and complete the project in phases. Does he need to change what he is going to submit to the city. I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning. He was contracted to complete the soils study. He says he will be done with his report by the end of the week. I dont know who needs this report.

Please respond to To cc Subject Behind the Stage Two FYI Western Price Survey Contacts CalISOs declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hourtohour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling Californias Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended. CalISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however. More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.",General Inquiry

"Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at 38,000 of which 14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugos number is 5122958052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.

Subject Sagewood Phase II George, Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the Sagewood
Phase II project. Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction. First, the proforma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. We adjusted
proforma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. Additionally, there are about 500
units coming online within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project. We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to 8,868,000. I have summarized our issues as follows 1. Proforma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows ProForma Banks Adjustment Unit Unit Rent RentBR Unit Rent RentBR 2 BR2.5 BA 1,150 575 950 475 3 BRUnit 1,530 510 1,250 417 2. Proforma expenses were increased to include a 350unit reserve for unit
turn over. 3. A market vacancy factor of 5 was applied to Potential Gross Income PGI. 4. Based on the Banks revised N.O.I. of 1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of 8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60 phantom interest rate. 5. The debt service will be approx. 874,000year. 6. Given the debt of 8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of 2,956,000, consisting of the following Land 1,121,670 Deferred profit Overhead 415,000 Cash Equity 1,419,268 Total 2,955,938 7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage of
actual hard construction costs. See attached file MAPTTRA.xls MAPTTRA.xls",Course Registration
"Today I let the builderdeveloper know that I would not proceed with his excessively high cost estimates. As he did not have the funds to take on the land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me. I would like to proceed and develop the property. My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA. I would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with. Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order. I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date. Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is Quattro Consultants out of Buda. Let me know if you have an opinion about either. I look forward to working with you.

"I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. I still have
the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high. I have gathered more information that support my
concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
10.5 million. The components are as follows Unit Cost, Site work, builders profit52sf 7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total 10.4 Since Reagans last 12 units are selling for around 190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over 95,000unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around 9.8
million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above 10.5
million. We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to discuss
alternatives. Phillip",General Inquiry

be in the range of 75 80. The proposed Loan to Value of 75 is within the
acceptable range for a typical MultiFamily deal. Given the above proforma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80 LTC. This, of course, is subject to the credit officer

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter Subject SM134 Proforma2.xls There have been some updates to the cost. The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least 84,000 additional. Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased. I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates. The managers unit is columns JL, but the total is not included in the BN
total of rentable units. Rather, the total cost for the managers unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities. I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity. The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained. Based on either a loan equal to 75 of value or 80 of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land. George W. Richards

we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement. They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different. Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject. It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect. I spoke to AMFs attorney today,
and explained the situation. They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied. AMFs broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after

"After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of construction management fees of 10. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10 fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I dont think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues dont seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process.

Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8 amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far.

"To cc Subject Lucy, Please fix 41 balance by deleting the 550 in the Rent Due column. The other questions I had about last weeks rent are 15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 119 then paid nothing on 126. What is going on? 25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit 27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, 260week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to 10hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the propertys tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.

"Please fix 41 balance by deleting the 550 in the Rent Due column. The other questions I had about last weeks rent are 15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 119 then paid nothing on 126. What is going on? 25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit 27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, 260week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to 10hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the propertys tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.

"The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a livingdining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage guestroom downstairs with a game room officeexercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I dont know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.

"Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. Operating expenses include 22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. Considering 1 2 115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you want to be ultra conservative use 100,000 at the lowest. 4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. A 10 note actually attractive.

cc Subject Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG CPUC Audit Report on Edison Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on 01302001 1002 AM Daniel Douglass 01302001 0831 AM To , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , cc Subject CPUC Audit Report on Edison The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG audit report on Southern California Edison I. Cash Needs
Highlights
SCE,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations and other measures. Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE,s available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of 51.8 million to 1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default. Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and payable.
SCE,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE,s credit ratings on most of its rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess various price scenarios upon SCE,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a 460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital improvement component as follows in millions
Operating and maintenance costs 77
Capital Improvement Costs 383
Total 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, parttime and contract positions to be eliminated with approximately 75 of the total staff reduction coming from contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling 383 million are for the most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost savings of approximately 92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery TRA and TCBA Activity
Highlights
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the Transition Cost Balancing Account TCBA Account of 494.5 million. This includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of 500 million and accelerated revenues of 175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE,s Transition Account TRA of 4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit balance of 1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to D.0101018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets. Our comments are summarized as follows
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal,s impact on SCE,s balance sheet would initially be to shift costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of 2.7 billion and a positive cash flow from operations of 7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to its parent, Edison International, of approximately 4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its shareholders of 1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common stock of 2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
there is no Section VII VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately 400500 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999. In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50 to over 600 million. This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.

"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing 1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80 of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 6535 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas 1. Fixed construction profit of 1.4 million. Builder doesnt benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. 5 equity for meeting time and costs in original plan 51sq ft, phase 1 complete in November 5 equity for under budget and ahead of schedule 5 equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 6040, but could be as favorable as 5545.

cc Subject Status of QF negotiations on QFs Legislative Update This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm RE NonGasfired QFs The last email I sent includes the latest version of the IEP proposal. Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially complete. PGE is OK with the docs. All QFs but Calpine have agreed with the IEP proposal Under the proposal, PGE would retain 106 million of what, Im not sure I think they mean a refund to PGE from QFs who switched to PX pricing. The money would come from changing the basis for the QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December and maybe earlier. PGE will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get some assurances of payment. SCE has defaulted with its QFs PGE has not yet but big payments are due on 2201. For gasfired QFs Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PGEs purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements Elcantar and Bloom, but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.

"As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. Traders do that all the time theyre looking forward, said William Burson, a trader. It makes the market for natural gas. But the markets response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Associations director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. Its a little frustrating that they dont take the time to understand what we are reporting, McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons and culprits is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the markets speculators for the rise in gas prices. Its my firm belief ... that todays gas prices are being manipulated, Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winters startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixedrate contracts and hedging a sort of price insurance that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. Were passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over, said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. Theres been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change, said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a 1,456 December bill for heating the church more than double the previous Decembers bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. Its the talk of the town here, he said. A year ago that wasnt a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above 2 per thousand cubic feet a level that producers say didnt make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting 4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at 5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But 10 gas was coming. Belownormal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. Its all about the weather, said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to 10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most pricevolatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders dont need to know much about gas or whatever commodity theyre trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than 7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly 10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Associations weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summers unusually high 4 to 5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when belownormal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest yearend storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the associations McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didnt share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if Decembers cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. I was getting worried, he said. Then suddenly the market turned when Januarys weather turned warmer. Wednesdays storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than 1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers costofgas charge earlier this month to 8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to 9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a levelpayment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about 25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energys gas purchasing practices. Consumers are taking all the risk, Micheel said. Its time to consider some changes.

"Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing 1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80 of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 6535 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas 1. Fixed construction profit of 1.4 million. Builder doesnt benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. 5 equity for meeting time and costs in original plan 51sq ft, phase 1 complete in November 5 equity for under budget and ahead of schedule 5 equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 6040, but could be as favorable as 5545.

"We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA. In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself. The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas. He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared. Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governors ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees. His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level. He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at 3000MW. He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by 02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided. He seemed interested in 1 the buy down of significant demand, 2 the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3 getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4 setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases. As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming. Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants. The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. This was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.
State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand instate gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here.
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos Jeff, again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help. We made some progress today.",Course Registration

"I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 7134638626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list 1. Examine LDCs incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDCs sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasnt maximized operationally. Specific questions should include 1. Why in March 00May 00 werent total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFOs on weekends that push away too much gas from Socals system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip",General Inquiry

Please respond to To Phillip Allen , Larry Lewter cc Subject SM134 Proforma.xls Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser. Note that the
construction management fee CMF is stated at 12.5 rather than our
standard rate of 10. This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity. Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high. Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost 49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is 5455 with CMF. It appears that the cash equity will be 1,784,876. However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with 1.5MM. I hope to finish the proforma today. The rental rates that we project are
1250 for the 3 ADA units, 11501200 for the 2 bedroom and 1425 for the 3

"If you have any questions, please contact Kristin Walsh at 713 8539510. Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May 8th deadline. Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart. According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis. Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double dip into the fund. Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor. However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. If not, the state may be in breach of contract. Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult. The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion. However, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession. Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB 8X and AB 31X. AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to 10 billion in bonds. This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support. AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts. However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X. Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy. According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund. For instance, Tony Strickland has stated that only 12 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion should be issued. Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday. Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount	4.125 B
Lenders JP Morgan 2.5 B Lehman Brothers 1.0 B Bear Stearns 625 M
Tax Exempt Portion	Of the 4.125 B 1.6 B is expected to be taxexempt
Projected Interest Rate	Taxable Rate 5.77 TaxExempt Rate 4.77
Current Projected Blended IR 5.38
Maturity Date August 29, 2001
For more details please contact me at 713 8539510 Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes 5 billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority. The 5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the same as the 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward. Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations. Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support. No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power. Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. However, this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor. The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it. The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash. The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount. In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities. If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy. SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",Course Registration

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Claudia L. Crocker Subject Investment Structure STRUCTURE
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or LLC
general partner. The General Partner owns 1 of the project and carries the
liability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investors do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits
is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS
The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as
high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at
2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000
which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required
of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
spec loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the
builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans
in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for
presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting. BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand. INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating. CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped. PRESELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS

End Table Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss Los Angeles, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices. According to Belton, Missouribased Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal. At the CaliforniaOregon Border, heavy load power fell
172.00 from yesterday to 430.00475.00. What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have, said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower. Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend. Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between 2021, down 3 from yesterday. Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall, said one Northwest power trader. At the NP15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
206.25 from yesterday to 325.00450.00. Light load energy fell
to 200.00350.00, falling 175.00 from yesterday. PSC of New Mexicos 498megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend. At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
325.00335.00 plunging 182.50 from yesterday. Robert Scalabrino PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas Philadelphia, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy Peak nextday
power prices declined at the western hub of the PennsylvaniaNew
JerseyMaryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of 12.75 a megawatthour, with trades
ranging from 62.0076.00. Lexington, Massachusettsbased Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrows high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from todays expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday. Most of the days activity took place in the early part of
the morning, said one PJMbased trader. By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up. Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices. Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of 1.25 per million
British thermal units to 8.608.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
2.44 per million Btu, as revised 610 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements. In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into highpriced hourly markets. Peak nextday power at the Zone A delivery point sold 6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of 70.33, amid trades in the
67.0075.00 range. Power at Zone J sold 7.50 higher at 90.00
92.00. Karyn Rispoli MidContinent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices Cincinnati, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy U.S. MidContinent
nextday peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnatibased Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped 23.19
to 67.90 a megawatthour, with trades ranging from 75.00 as the
market opened down to 59.00 after options expired. In MidAmerica Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicagobased Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold 21.37 lower
on average at 60.0075.00, while power in lower MAIN sold 18.17
lower at 65.00100.00. Belton, Missouribased Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively. Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gasfired
generation to meet increased weatherrelated demand. Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at 7.808.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at 7.658.15 per million Btu. The weathers moderating and gas is down, so youve got
people coming to their senses, one trader said. These are much
more realistic prices. Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 1822 was offered at 60.00, down from 90.00
yesterday. MidContinent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling 37.67 less in northern MAPP and 44.17 less in
southern MAPP at 75.00125.00. Whats happening is the people who dont have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice, one MAPP trader said. Then youve got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off, he said, and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the days high and low trade. Ken Fahnestock Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said. Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid50s Fahrenheit later this week. There was nothing going on in Florida today, said one
southern energy trader. Everything was going to markets in the
north. Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid70s a megawatthour. Prices into TVA started in the 80s and 90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out, said on Entergy power trader. Prices,
declined to 60 and less. The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of 23.95
to 70.25 amid trades in the 65.0080.00 range. Offpeak trades
were noted at 32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates. Southeast power traders said revised 610 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region. In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices. The cold weathers backing off, said one SPP utility
trader. It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today its about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold. Power sold in northern sections of SPP at 78100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to 88.00. Southern
SPP traded at 82.00, 2 more than yesterday. Brian Whary U.K. DayAhead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand London, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. The dayahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatthour. Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S. Dayahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.720.15
pounds a megawatthour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.918.05 pounds a
megawatthour, 40 pence below yesterdays last trade. First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said. January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.624.73 pounds a
megawatthour, falling 17 pence. First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.621.7 pounds a
megawatthour, 10 pence below its previous close. Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatthour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatthour. Open positions on many shortterm structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed. Nick Livingstone Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. Week 51 dealt between 145152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterdays closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50140.25 kroner a megawatthour. Supply from hydroproducers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing. Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating. Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said. The markets been waiting for this day for a long time, a
Stockholmbased trader said. For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasnt lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price. Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S. The dayahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling. Thursdays system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatthour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 1015 kroner by the start of next week. Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter
term contracts. Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75138.5 kroner a megawatthour,
1.9 kroner below yesterdays last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatthour. Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydroproducers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said. Vattenfalls Ringhals 1, an 835megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. Todays rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
todays news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. Nick Livingstone

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like Excel. What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter Subject Westgate Westgate Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investors Alliance.
Investors Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for 2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly 1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12month lease and
1.301.40 psf if leased on a 12month term, but by individual room. This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be 300,000 to secure the land. I will
know more on this question later today. Sincerely, George W. Richards

"Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 4.704.80 for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly 10 to 15 cents lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online EOL, Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms Amerex, APB, and Prebon. Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows 1. The high physical prices on the 26th 27th 4.75,4,80 are much greater than the high financial trades 4.6375,4.665 on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points Socal Northwest is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesnt make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70s and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.

"As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 4.704.80 for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly 10 to 15 cents lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online EOL, Enrons direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms Amerex, APB, and Prebon.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Claudia L. Crocker Subject Investment Structure STRUCTURE
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or LLC
general partner. The General Partner owns 1 of the project and carries the
liability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investors do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits
is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS
The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as
high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at
2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000
which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required
of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
spec loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the
builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans
in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for
presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting. BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand. INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating. CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped. PRESELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS

Is the closing today?? After reviewing the agreement?I find it isnt binding as far as I can determine.? It is too vague and it doesnt sound like anything an attorney or title company would?draft for a real estate closingbut, of course, I could be wrong.? ?
If this?closing is going to take place without this agreement then there is no point in me following up on this?documents validity.? ?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents and see whats there and find out where I am with that and deal with this as best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an exhibit to a recordable document or something a little more exact, or rather?sort of a contract.? This isnt either.? I tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last night but he was out of pocket.? I talked to a crim. atty friend and he said this is out of his area but doesnt sound binding to him.? ?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allens transaction?and take a look at that but as vague and general as this is I doubt that my signature? is even needed to complete this transaction.? I am in after 12 noon if there is any need to contact me regarding the closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself and I dont want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesnt seem to be something required for a closing.? In the event you do need my signature on something like this I would rather have time to have it reviewed before I accept it.

Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names? These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me. Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process. Phillip",General Inquiry
"George Richards on 09082000 052149 AM
Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter Subject Westgate ProformaPhillip Allen.xls Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40 per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street
widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of 680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an AD Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at 700,000 for a 50 interest in the
profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
5123381119 or 5123381110. My cell phone is 5127487495 and the fax is

on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

"Here sales numbers from Reagan As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot. The 13081308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling. At 2.7 MM, my bid is .70sf higher than his units under construction. I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way. The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date. Let me know what you think.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter Subject Westgate ProformaPhillip Allen.xls Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40 per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street
widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of 680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an AD Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Diana Zuniga Subject Sagewood Town Homes I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the 180s, He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a he is selling them during construction and b they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 11641302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be 73.80 psf at 182,000. I thought his
sales price was 187,000. At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for 203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a the rental rate and b the
rentability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation. As for rentability, I believe that we have shown that the
3bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

cc Subject Thoughts on Presentation It is a shame that the CAISO doesnt provide actual generation by unit. The WSCC data, which is dicey and we dont have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. For your purposes the CAISO may suffice. I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation. You are pulling scheduled. If someone doesnt schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that. You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. While they dont split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number. The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually underscheduling depending on price. I think the presentation looks good. It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished.

cc Subject Transport pl Phillip
Ive noticed one thing on your intramonth transport pl that looks strange to me. Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but Ill point it out and let you decide. Let me know if this is O.K. as is, so Ill know to ignore it in the future. Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and Ill take care of it.. On PGE NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 235,019. If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate plnot change your overall pl. Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal s, paths and pl impacts of each. 139195 From Kingsgate to Malin 182,030 139196 From Kingsgate to PGENTuscarora 4,024 139197 From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin 8,271 231321 From Kingsgate to Malin 38,705 153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield 1,988 Suggested fix Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDPMalin Citygate to GDPKingsgate. Clay Basin storagethis is really a FYI more than anything elseI see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activityone appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. Im not sure of the best way to handle this since we dont really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, heres the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. There may be an operational reason why this occurred that Im not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought Id bring it to your attention just in case theres something you want to do about it.

cc Christopher F CalgerPDX, Michael McDonaldSF Subject Re SW Gas Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning. They were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal. However, they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings. We are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals. Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a nonprofit and costly function procurement and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product. As to your other question. We have yet to identify or pursue other candidates however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities. We met with 8 entities this week 7 Municipals and SWG as we implement our strategy in California. Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach? Otherwise, we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

cc Subject SW Gas Janie, Thanks for the fax on SW Gas. We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio fixed, indexed, collars.... should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of their PGAs and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management do you have any preference on structure? Are there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Laird",General Inquiry

"Hi, We recently faced the same questions concerning our cement floor finishing heres what we found. Oringinal Plan was for stamped and pigmented color added at the cement
plant with stained accents and highlighting to simulate a sautillo tile. Our
project is rather large 2900 sq ft SB house with 1800 sq ft porch surrounding it.
Lots of cement approx. 160 sq yds. After looking at the costs we changed our
minds rather quickly. Labor for Stamping Crew 2500.00 Davis Color Stain 4lbs per yd x 100 yds x 18 lb 7200.00 These are above and beyond the cost of the concrete. Actual Result Took a truck and trailer to Mexico and handpicked Sautillo
tiles for inside the house. Changed the color of the cement on the porch to 1lb
per yd mix color, added the overrun tiles we had left over as stringers in the
porch and accented with acid etched stain. Tiles and Transportation 3000.00 Labor, mastic and beer. tile setting did it myself 1400.00 Acid Stain for porch 350.00 Davis Pigment 15 x 40 yds 600.00 I can get you the info on the stain if you like, I ordered it from a
company the web, cant remember off hand who. I ordered a sample kit for 35.00 which
has 7 colors you can mix and match for the results you want. It was easy to work

End Table Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid WeatherRelated Demand Los Angeles, May 14 Bloomberg Energy Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand. At the SP15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped 186.88 to a Bloomberg index of 205.00 a megawatt
hour, amid trades in the 175.00225.00 range. Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline, said one Southwest trader. According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight. At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of 220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the 210.00240.00 range. Traders said that Arizonas Public Service Co. 1,270megawatt
Palo Verde1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31. At the MidColumbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Fridays SundayMonday package to a
Bloomberg index of 205.40, with trades at 175.00225.00. According to Belton, Missouribased Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal. We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop, said one Northwest trader. At the NP15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell 189.39 to a Bloomberg index of 207.75, with trades at
175.00228.00. According the California Independent System Operator todays
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand Philadelphia, May 14 Bloomberg Energy An increase in
available generation coupled with less weatherrelated demand,
caused nextday power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said. According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively. In the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volumeweighted index of 35.97 per megawatt hour, down 5.48 from
Friday. Theres just no weather out there, said one PJMbased
trader. Theres no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, its going to be that way all week
long. Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday. Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow. Nextday prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities. The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk. Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped 4.50 to
58.50, while Zones G and A fell 3.25 and 5.50, respectively, to
51.25 and 40.00 indices. Karyn Rispoli WeatherRelated Demand Drives MidContinent Power Prices Up Cincinnati, May 14 Bloomberg Energy Dayahead peak
power prices rose today in the MidContinent U.S. as high
weatherrelated demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said. Its supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA Tennessee
Valley Authority area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there, one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
Dailies and the balance of week are both stronger because of
that. The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnatibased Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
3.52 to 31.17 a megawatthour, with trades ranging from 29.25
when the market opened up to 35.00 after options expired. Cinergy power for WednesdayFriday delivery sold at 39.00
and power for May 2125 was offered at 45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week. Nextday power in TVA sold 2.15 higher on average at
28.0037.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday. Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because theres enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices, an
ECAR trader said. In MidAmerica Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume. Peak Monday parcels sold 2.25 higher on average at the
Chicagobased Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at 29.5034.50,
and 5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from 32.0040.00. MidContinent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
abovenormal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lowerpriced eastern hubs. ForTuesday power sold 7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at 45.0050.00 and 6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at 45.0052.00. Lexington, Massachusettsbased Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrows high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska. Theres no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Amerens grid too, one MAPP trader said.
Its likely to cause problems all week, since its hot here and
down in SPP the Southwest Power Pool. Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up Atlanta, May 14 Bloomberg Energy U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said. Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusettsbased Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than todays projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday. Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high80s to low90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said. The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatthour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to 37.20.
Trades ranged from 26.5042.50. On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of 2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of 34.44 amid
trades in the 28.0037.00 range. In Texas, dayahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of 47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000. Theres just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have, said one Texasbased utility power trader.
Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 9395 degree
Fahrenheit days. This year so far, the highest weve seen is
85 degrees, so thats about 10 degrees below normal for us. On the Entergy Corp. grid, dayahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at 38.5042.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of 40.25, 1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused dayahead prices to trade late at
3536. Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing dayahead energy
at 37 from utilities in the VirginiaCarolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC. Southern dayahead power traded 2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of 37, amid trades in the 3539 range. In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at 47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as 48.75. BalanceofMay Entergy
power was bid at 48, though few offers were heard, traders
said. On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at 40, though the nearest offer was 45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at 41, though no new trades
were noted. Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids London, May 14 Bloomberg Energy Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said. Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatthour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatthour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatthour, 11 pence lower than
Friday. The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said. Shorterterm contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said. June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatthour. On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week. Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said. Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest Lysaker, Norway, May 14 Bloomberg Energy Longerterm
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydrosupply, traders said. Winter2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatthour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatthour.
Winter1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50
214.00 kroner a megawatthour. The market crash everyone was waiting for never came now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions, an Oslo
based trader said. Im surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing. Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a more
realistic expectation following recent overestimation of wet
outlooks. Tuesdays system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatthour at 185.70 kroner a megawatthour,
down 7.45 kroner from todays price. Still, traders said this was
a high spot price for this time of the year. Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatthour
with 140 megawatts exchanged. Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatthours
generation, up 368 percent from Fridays 1,169 gigawatthours. Alejandro Barbajosa

"If you have any questions, please contact Kristin Walsh at 713 8539510. Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May 8th deadline. Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart. According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. The Democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis. Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double dip into the fund. Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor. However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. If not, the state may be in breach of contract. Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult. The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion. However, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession. Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB 8X and AB 31X. AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to 10 billion in bonds. This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support. AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts. However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X. Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy. According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund. For instance, Tony Strickland has stated that only 12 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion should be issued. Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday. Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount 4.125 B
Lenders JP Morgan 2.5 B Lehman Brothers 1.0 B Bear Stearns 625 M
Tax Exempt Portion Of the 4.125 B 1.6 B is expected to be taxexempt
Projected Interest Rate Taxable Rate 5.77 TaxExempt Rate 4.77
Current Projected Blended IR 5.38
Maturity Date August 29, 2001
For more details please contact me at 713 8539510 Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes 5 billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority. The 5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the same as the 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward. Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations. Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support. No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power. Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. However, this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor. The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it. The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash. The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount. In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities. If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy. SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",Course Registration

cc Subject Re This mornings Commission meeting delayed Phil, I suspect that discussionsnegotiations are taking place behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms, if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers. Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. Hope this info helps. Ray Phillip K 04252001 0228 PM

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far e.g., March 2001 vs. March 2000 was absolutely correct. At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6. This translates into a reduction of about 1,5001,600 MWa for last month March 2001 as compared with the previous year. Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts. Other forecasters e.g., PIRA are estimating that another 1,2001,300 MWa making total yearonyear reduction 2,7002,800 will come off starting in June. This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. Given that the 6 decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10 relative to last year. This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,3003,500 MWa in JunAug. In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89 of total Calif load, or 3637 of WSCC U.S. summer load. I think it is reasonable to assume that the nonISO portion of Calif i.e., LADWP and IID will see similar reductions in demand. As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years if BPA gets its wish. This figure represents approx 4 of the nonCalif WSCC. Several mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production. I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Califs economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10 reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I think we could easily expect an additional 23 on top of the 4 already realized, or approx 1,0001,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the nonCalif WSCC for this summer. This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,5007,000 MWa when compared with last summer. I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available. Meantime, I hope this helps.

As I mentioned I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get back in touch with you once he is finished. Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager from San Antonio. For my first development project, I feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining FHA financing. We are working with Kipp Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings. Your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently 165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of 94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and TransportationCorpEnron or 7138537060 with any questions.

"I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221d loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows 5 onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2 overhead 4 profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate 219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to 10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services.

"Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs 1. Is the framing Lumber 2 yellow pine? Wouldnt fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents power or turbine? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didnt know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 12 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 AC units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up. I am going to call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas. Phillip

What is the 617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high?

Something that I forgot to ask you. Do you know if Hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks? Also let me know about the parking. The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code. The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem. They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms. Phillip,General Inquiry

"The agreement looks fine. My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project. Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them 1,300,000? I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of 5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. Phillip",Payment & Fees

Please respond to To cc Subject Behind the Stage Two FYI Western Price Survey Contacts CalISOs declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hourtohour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling Californias Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended. CalISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however. More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.",General Inquiry

Subject Sagewood Phase II George, Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the Sagewood
Phase II project. Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction. First, the proforma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. We adjusted
proforma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. Additionally, there are about 500
units coming online within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project. We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to 8,868,000. I have summarized our issues as follows 1. Proforma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows ProForma Banks Adjustment Unit Unit Rent RentBR Unit Rent RentBR 2 BR2.5 BA 1,150 575 950 475 3 BRUnit 1,530 510 1,250 417 2. Proforma expenses were increased to include a 350unit reserve for unit
turn over. 3. A market vacancy factor of 5 was applied to Potential Gross Income PGI. 4. Based on the Banks revised N.O.I. of 1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of 8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60 phantom interest rate. 5. The debt service will be approx. 874,000year. 6. Given the debt of 8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of 2,956,000, consisting of the following Land 1,121,670 Deferred profit Overhead 415,000 Cash Equity 1,419,268 Total 2,955,938 7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage of
actual hard construction costs. See attached file MAPTTRA.xls MAPTTRA.xls",Course Registration

the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our

10.5 million. The components are as follows Unit Cost, Site work, builders profit52sf 7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total 10.4 Since Reagans last 12 units are selling for around 190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over 95,000unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A

produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around 9.8
million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above 10.5

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter Subject SM134 Proforma2.xls There have been some updates to the cost. The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least 84,000 additional. Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased. I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates. The managers unit is columns JL, but the total is not included in the BN
total of rentable units. Rather, the total cost for the managers unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities. I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity. The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained. Based on either a loan equal to 75 of value or 80 of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land. George W. Richards

To cc Subject leander and the Stage Phillip, I spoke with AMFs broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement. They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different. Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject. It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect. I spoke to AMFs attorney today,
and explained the situation. They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied. AMFs broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing. We may close this deal in April. The Stage is still on go. An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,

"After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of construction management fees of 10. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10 fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I dont think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues dont seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process.

"I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8. There are several reasons that I wont commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8 amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far.

What is going on? 25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit 27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith.

Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, 260week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now.

"The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a livingdining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage guestroom downstairs with a game room officeexercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I dont know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.

"Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. Operating expenses include 22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. Considering 1 2 115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you want to be ultra conservative use 100,000 at the lowest. 4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. A 10 note actually attractive.

cc Subject Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG CPUC Audit Report on Edison Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on 01302001 1002 AM Daniel Douglass 01302001 0831 AM To , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , cc Subject CPUC Audit Report on Edison The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG audit report on Southern California Edison I. Cash Needs
Highlights
SCE,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations and other measures. Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE,s available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of 51.8 million to 1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default. Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and payable.
SCE,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE,s credit ratings on most of its rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess various price scenarios upon SCE,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a 460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital improvement component as follows in millions
Operating and maintenance costs 77
Capital Improvement Costs 383
Total 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, parttime and contract positions to be eliminated with approximately 75 of the total staff reduction coming from contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling 383 million are for the most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost savings of approximately 92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery TRA and TCBA Activity
Highlights
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the Transition Cost Balancing Account TCBA Account of 494.5 million. This includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of 500 million and accelerated revenues of 175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE,s Transition Account TRA of 4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit balance of 1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to D.0101018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets. Our comments are summarized as follows
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal,s impact on SCE,s balance sheet would initially be to shift costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of 2.7 billion and a positive cash flow from operations of 7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to its parent, Edison International, of approximately 4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its shareholders of 1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common stock of 2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
there is no Section VII VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately 400500 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999. In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50 to over 600 million. This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.

"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing 1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80 of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 6535 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas 1. Fixed construction profit of 1.4 million. Builder doesnt benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. 5 equity for meeting time and costs in original plan 51sq ft, phase 1 complete in November 5 equity for under budget and ahead of schedule 5 equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 6040, but could be as favorable as 5545.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially complete. PGE is OK with the docs. All QFs but Calpine have agreed with the IEP proposal Under the proposal, PGE would retain 106 million of what, Im not sure I think they mean a refund to PGE from QFs who switched to PX pricing. The money would come from changing the basis for the QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December and maybe earlier. PGE will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get some assurances of payment. SCE has defaulted with its QFs PGE has not yet but big payments are due on 2201. For gasfired QFs Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PGEs purchases from such QFs.

"As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. Traders do that all the time theyre looking forward, said William Burson, a trader. It makes the market for natural gas. But the markets response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Associations director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. Its a little frustrating that they dont take the time to understand what we are reporting, McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons and culprits is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the markets speculators for the rise in gas prices. Its my firm belief ... that todays gas prices are being manipulated, Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winters startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixedrate contracts and hedging a sort of price insurance that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. Were passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over, said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. Theres been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change, said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a 1,456 December bill for heating the church more than double the previous Decembers bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. Its the talk of the town here, he said. A year ago that wasnt a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above 2 per thousand cubic feet a level that producers say didnt make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting 4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at 5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But 10 gas was coming. Belownormal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. Its all about the weather, said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to 10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most pricevolatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders dont need to know much about gas or whatever commodity theyre trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than 7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly 10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Associations weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summers unusually high 4 to 5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when belownormal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest yearend storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the associations McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didnt share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if Decembers cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. I was getting worried, he said. Then suddenly the market turned when Januarys weather turned warmer. Wednesdays storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than 1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers costofgas charge earlier this month to 8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to 9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a levelpayment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about 25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energys gas purchasing practices. Consumers are taking all the risk, Micheel said. Its time to consider some changes.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen , Larry Lewter cc Subject SM134 Proforma.xls Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser. Note that the
construction management fee CMF is stated at 12.5 rather than our
standard rate of 10. This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity. Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high. Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost 49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is 5455 with CMF. It appears that the cash equity will be 1,784,876. However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with 1.5MM. I hope to finish the proforma today. The rental rates that we project are
1250 for the 3 ADA units, 11501200 for the 2 bedroom and 1425 for the 3

"Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing 1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80 of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 6535 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas 1. Fixed construction profit of 1.4 million. Builder doesnt benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. 5 equity for meeting time and costs in original plan 51sq ft, phase 1 complete in November 5 equity for under budget and ahead of schedule 5 equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 6040, but could be as favorable as 5545.

"We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA. In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself. The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas. He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared. Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governors ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees. His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level. He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at 3000MW. He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by 02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided. He seemed interested in 1 the buy down of significant demand, 2 the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3 getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4 setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases. As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming. Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants. The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. This was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.
State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand instate gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here.
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos Jeff, again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help. We made some progress today.",Course Registration

"I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 7134638626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list 1. Examine LDCs incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDCs sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasnt maximized operationally. Specific questions should include 1. Why in March 00May 00 werent total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFOs on weekends that push away too much gas from Socals system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Claudia L. Crocker Subject Investment Structure STRUCTURE
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or LLC
general partner. The General Partner owns 1 of the project and carries the
liability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investors do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits
is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS
The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as
high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at
2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000
which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required
of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
spec loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the
builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans
in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for
presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting. BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand. INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating. CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped. PRESELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested. I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. Sincerely, George Richards

Revenues from continuing operations US3.7 billion Pro forma net lossa per share US0.68 before incremental charges US0.27 Net loss from continuing operations US3.5 billion Positive operating cashflow contributes to increase in cash to US3.4 billion Nortel Networks Corporationb NYSENTTSENT. today reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2001 prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. Revenues from continuing operations were US3.69 billion for the third quarter of 2001 compared to US6.73 billion in the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operationsa for the third quarter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US854 million or US0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operationsa for the third quarter of 2001 was US2.18 billion, or US0.68 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US597 million, or US0.19 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000. In the quarter, incremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operationsa were comprised of US750 million pretax for excess and obsolete inventory, primarily related to Optical InterCity US767 million pretax for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer financing and US380 million pretax primarily related to charges associated with certain third party investments. The Company also recorded a US801 million pretax charge for restructuring associated with the completion of the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001 and a US223 million pretax charge primarily related to the approximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components business. Including Acquisition Related Costsa, stock option compensation from acquisitions and divestitures, and onetime gains and charges, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2001 of US3.47 billion or US1.08 per common share. Revenues for the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry adjusted to new levels of spending, said John Roth, president and chief executive officer Nortel Networks. Our bottom line results reflected the impact of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During the third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implement its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive break even at a quarterly revenue level well below US4 billion. The structure is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002. Frank Dunn, the Companys new president and chief executive officer effective November 1, 2001, said, Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organization to drive continued leadership across three businesses Metro Networks, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services and voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product programs continued to advance as we focused on building on our industryleading portfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reductions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of opportunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 days included the First North American ILEC began the circuit to packet transition with the deployment of our carriergrade softswitch Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe and Japan Announced Multiservice backbone awards ATM, IP, MPLS in China, Germany and Asia Continued progress on 3G Wireless Internet infrastructure deployments and completed the first commercial UMTS test calls and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP call Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated Layer 47 content switching capability on our Layer 23 Edge Switch Router and Completed hardware design, significantly advanced software integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX solution. As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion of its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reductions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continue to divest noncore businesses in accordance with its work plan. The number of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity including the impact of divestures announced or completed to date is expected to ultimately approach 10,000 positions. Commenting on cash management in the quarter, Frank Dunn said, We are extremely pleased with the results that have been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a significant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operations. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by completing a highly successful US1.8 billion convertible debt issue which, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operations and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhanced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and actions we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet is well positioned. While we believe we are beginning to see early indications that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainable levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the uncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wake of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and businesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time, concluded Dunn. Revenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations Network Infrastructure revenues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Europe. Optical Intercity revenues were down sharply in the United States, Europe and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia. Photonic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was largely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Intercity solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000. Other revenues declined 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Substantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and strong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable declines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wireless OEM revenues in most regions. Commensurate with its announcement on October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses Metro Networks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks, Nortel Networks will evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001. Geographic revenues for the third quarter of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the United States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States and Canada. NineMonth Results For the first nine months of 2001, revenues from continuing operations were US14.06 billion compared to US19.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operationsa for the first nine months of 2001 was US4.01 billion, or US1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US1.57 billion, or US0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations, Acquisition Related Costsa, stock option compensation from acquisitions and divestitures, onetime gains and charges, and the write down of intangible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US25.48 billion, or US8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001. Spending Management The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its cost structure. Compared to the Companys yearend 2000 cost structure, exclusive of incremental provisions and charges, the Companys cost structure at the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US1 billion. Gross Margin Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the expected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Excluding the impact of these incremental and other contractrelated charges, gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compared to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001. Expenses Selling, general and administrative SGA expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were US1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market adjustments and further decline in some of our of customers financial condition resulted in incremental provisions of US767 million in the quarter related to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental provisions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US190 million. Research and development RD expenses were US808 million in the third quarter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments to drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the elimination of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001, R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US100 million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operations.

We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to . Youll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? Answer GG As long as Schroeder ankle is healthy, hes a must start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but wed have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, wed recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. Its tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. Question Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend? Answer GG Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so wed have to side with Weinke. Hell be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game. Question Scott Buzby, Newark, DE Who should I start this week Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks? Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available. Answer GG Franks has been Brett Favres favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel hes just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player. Tip of the Week Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season. This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

"Ken Indigestion Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 All those new natural gasfired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.
For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GEs Power Systems group almost tripled to 25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nations growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. Ah, but there was a flaw in that argumentone that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below 2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as 10 last year. A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet. Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollutionspewing coal units, which still supply half the nations electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. Studness determined that 79 of the new electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coalfired units. And theres plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatthours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5ayear increase in demand. Coals advantage over gas Its cheap. Utilities paid an average of 1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with 4.30 for gas delivered. Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine nyse CPN news people and other independent power producers, see table, below will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. Addressing a Burning Issue If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn. WINNERS Sales bil Remarks Calpine 4.6 Its gas power plants wont compete with coal for years Chesapeake Energy 0.9 Hedged gas production through December 2003 Dynegy 43.4 Owns gas, coal power plants stores, trades gas Peabody Energy 2.7 Worlds largest coal company LOSERS Sales bil Remarks Devon Energy 3.3 Gasheavy 8 billion in ...debt General Electric 129.5 Sells gas turbines Pioneer Natural Resources 1.0 1.5 billion in ...debt 53 of production is gas Transocean SedcoForex 1.9 4 billion in debt heavy gasdrilling exposure Latest 12 months. Source Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. Its not our game to compete with coal or nuclear, says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gasfired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. Its our game to displace older gas. Combinedcycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatthour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houstonbased Dynegy, an energytrading firm that also owns both coal and gasfired power plants. Dynegys 35yearold coal plants are huge capital hogs, Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. But coalplant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40yearold plants 12 last yearwhile reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15 increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. Long term, the bullish scenario still holds Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.",Course Registration

Diluted earnings per share were .22, down 59 percent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled 5.5 billion, down one percent from 5.6 billion a year ago. The companys return on equity was 14.2 percent. Results for the third quarter were negatively affected by two significant items a previously announced restructuring charge of 352 million pretax 232 million aftertax and the impacts from the September 11th terrorist attacks. The September 11th events resulted in certain onetime costs and business interruption losses, including provisions related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, insurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination of these items totaled approximately 98 million pretax 65 million aftertax. The company also incurred costs of approximately 42 million since September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of the companys offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the companys offices, extra operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluated. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses will be covered by insurance. The third quarter restructuring charge includes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and asset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reorganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending in certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locations, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain processing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expected to produce expense savings of approximately 325 million in 2002. A portion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form of improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinvested back into highgrowth areas of the business. In addition to the activities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the year and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of 700 million. Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and onetime costs related to September 11th, was approximately 595 million, down 19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were .45, down 17 percent. The companys adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent. While we were on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terrorist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and investment activity slowed after September 11th, said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. In light of the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering initiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our businesses with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated benefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franchise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in the economy. Travel Related Services TRS reported quarterly net income of 248 million, down 51 percent from 507 million in the third quarter a year ago. Included in third quarter results are 195 million pretax 127 million aftertax of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also included in the results are 87 million pretax 57 million aftertax of onetime costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist attacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS net income would have been 432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last year. TRS net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee revenues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a 28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decrease in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel since September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarter was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offset a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance charge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yields. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introductory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter. The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending writeoff rates and delinquencies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certain marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and business volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineering and costcontrol efforts. The above discussion presents TRS results on a managed basis as if there had been no securitization transactions, which conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS results on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both formats. On a reported basis, TRS results included securitization gains of 29 million pretax 19 million aftertax and 26 million pretax 17 million aftertax in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. These gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses. American Express Financial Advisors AEFA reported quarterly net income of 145 million, down 46 percent from 269 million in the third quarter a year ago. Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are 62 million pretax 41 million aftertax of the restructuring charge noted earlier and 11 million pretax 8 million aftertax of insurance claims directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFAs net income would have been 194 million, down 28 percent from last year. AEFA results reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, management and distribution fees fell 15 percent. Operating expenses, excluding the abovementioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and costcontrol initiatives. As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the companys 33 billion investment portfolio consisted of highyield securities, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduction reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfolio and concentrate on stronger credits. American Express Bank AEB reported a quarterly net loss of 43 million, compared with 7 million of net income a year ago. Included in third quarter results are 84 million pretax 57 million aftertax of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excluding these charges, AEBs net income would have been 15 million, approximately double the earnings recorded in the same period last year. While AEB sustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact AEBs quarterly results. AEBs business results reflect strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Results also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses as a result of AEBs reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by higher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan balances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Corporate and Other reported net expenses of 52 million, compared with 46 million a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are 11 million pretax 7 million aftertax of the restructuring charge noted earlier.

"Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock 540 mmcfd
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcfd
Needles 800 mmcfd
Wheeler 800 mmcfd New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcfd
Hector Rd 50 mmcfd
Both will be available around Feb 1 Basis of ProRationCurrent Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system. Gas Select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations. New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance. SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points. Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select. Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts. Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections. Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast. They use Weather Bank as one of their tools. OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well. Lots of complaints. People were complaining that it restricted access to the system. Eliminating point specific calculation. Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits. Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures. No changes to Wheeler Ridge. Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle. Replace windows with operational maximum volumes. If CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFOs
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows. Scheduling ChangesNov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid2002 . No direct dialup. Rollover nomsnoms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled overwill not be at discretion of 3rd party. However, can still make changes. Can still upload new files. 2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on Gas Select of OFO. Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline 2132443900 and list of email messages that can go directly to pagers. Gas Select is official notification. Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail. Gas Select is a subscriber based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFOs are going to be system wide and not customer specific. OFOs can be declared intraday. Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day. Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on. Dont want to go back and forth. This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works. Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcfday between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned. Scheduled vs. CapacityDeclare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110 of expected usage. Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week. Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed ProRata Rules
Expected Usagecut nominations to 110 of expected usage so will use same day of the prior week as proxy. Generators need to revise expected usage. Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions dont go into effect until after Cycle 4. Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed. If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised. If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows Cycle 1 Nom 1000 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized. Will allocate prorata. Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point. In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 oclock to 12 oclock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered. For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week. Declare OFO on prior days scheduled volume. For an evening declarationwill use most recent available scheduled volumes. For example Flow Day 104 103 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1 Cycle 2
Cycle 2 Intraday 1
Cycle 3 evening cyle 2 on 104
Cycle 4 Intraday 1 on 104 In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th. look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th look at evening cycle 2 on 104 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance see below. This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable.

Please review the two attachments below for final signoff and Acceptance of this deliverable. Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system Tims idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart. Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc After signoff on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase
?	Small storyline details Example company background, learner role
?	Resources reports and interviews Example add a news article, remove a storage report
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision Example add a substep where learner identifies the location of each risk have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before Changes to any other High Level Design elements Example add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal, or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. Issue Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. Thanks. Phillip, Tim Yevgeny if possible, please email with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 1023. Cheers

Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. Answer GG Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catchup against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. Question Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. Answer GG Gardners huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. Hell be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but well go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement. Question John Kersey, Denver, CO I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? Answer GG Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas. Tip of the Week Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL Remember that football is a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Dont be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh. This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

For assistance, please call 18009344448, press 4 then 4 to speak with a Retirement Plans Specialist. Restraints Will Be Overcome We see an irregular upward trend in the market. Stocks face some formidable hurdles. The risk of additional terrorism and fresh memories of the markets 18month downward spiral are inhibiting buying. So are dismal fourthquarter earnings preannouncements as the economic cycle approaches bottom, as well as continued high PE ratios on recessiondepressed profits. In addition, the supply of stock for sale at prices just above current levels is heavy, according to technical analysts. But we expect that these and other impediments will be overcome. And we note that market recoveries that proceed in halting fashion amid widespread skepticism often are the most sustainable. Congresss failure to pass a fiscal stimulus bill is not a major negative, according to SP chief economist David Wyss. The economy will recover anyway, says Wyss, with absence of the package pinching GDP growth in 2002 by only 0.2. Without fiscal stimulus, the chances of a 12th fed funds rate cut on January 30 are improved. Based on Wysss forecast of GDP turning positive in the first quarter and improving to an annual growth rate of 5 in the fourth quarter, investors should be getting more encouraging news before long. The recent rally lost upward momentum when it bumped up against overhead resistance at 1170 on the SP 500 on December 5. With the help of turnoftheyear reinvestment demand, the next attempt to work through this supply is likely to be more successful, says Mark Arbeter, SP chief technical analyst. But even if it is, the area of resistance runs all the way up to 1313, so Arbeter believes further progress in the period ahead will be labored. We think the SP 500 and Nasdaq will see doubledigit gains over the course of 2002. A portfolio allocation of 65 stocks, 20 bonds and 15 cash reserves remains appropriate.

"IMAGEFantasy Sports IMAGEFantasy Football IMAGECBS SportsLine.com Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter! The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your email inbox every Friday. Well include news about the web site tips on using all the features available and answers to your playerrelated questions from the Gridiron Guru. IMAGE	Inside ? Plan for the Playoffs ? GamebyGame Analysis ? Gridiron Guru ? Tip of the Week IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Plan for the Playoffs The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 games of Dec. 2223 and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 games of Dec. 2930. If youre in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season. If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if and WHEN your team competes in a playoff matchup. GamebyGame Analysis Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The players statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see whos been getting the most consistent production. Gridiron Guru Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where well answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to . Youll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question Mike Blake Im having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start AzZahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten? Answer GG Hakim is a hitormiss type, so hes risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and hes losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this weeks opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad. Question Russell Brown My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie. Answer GG Testaverdes Fantasy value has taken a real hit this season because of the Jets conservative offense. Flutie struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and wont have an easier time against Oakland. Wed suggest playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. Question Chris Gilcrest Who would you start at QB this weekend Rich Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would you bench Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, Curtis Martin? Answer GG Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but hes far too inconsistent to start over a player like Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike Anderson. You cant bench Martin, no matter how bad the matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his struggles this season and Pittmans matchup against Detroit is too good to ignore. Tip of the Week Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO Can Terrell Davis ever stay healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an unreliable, injuryprone shell of his former self.

"IMAGE 2002 Toyota Camry XLE BestSelling Style and Refinement The Toyota Camry casts a long shadow on the U.S. car market. It was introduced back in 1983 as a boxy hatchback and sedan that quickly became known for its eminent practicality and bulletproof reliability. Subsequent generations became larger and more powerful, with the Camry line expanding to include a wagon and a coupe. Toyota designed it to appeal to as many buyers as possible, and buyers responded by making the Camry one of Americas bestselling vehicles. For 2002, the Camry has been completely redesigned on a brandnew platform. The new generation is being sold solely as a fourdoor sedan, although last years Camry Solara continues as a coupe and convertible. Toyota claims that the new Camrys design is both sportier and more personal than the sedans that came before. We evaluated a Camry XLE to find out if Toyota hit its mark.

"IMAGE Market Insight for November 19, 2001 From IMAGE The Global Online Financial Services Firm Introducing Goldman Sachs PrimeAccesssm Research As a TD Waterhouse customer, you now have online access to Goldman Sachs PrimeAccesssm Research. Just login at tdwaterhouse.com , click on News Research, and then on Goldman Sachs. Gradual Uptrend Anticipated By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook We see further but slower market progress. Tired after their recent run, stocks nevertheless are being supported by signs that the economy is stabilizing, better news from Afghanistan and a large pool of cash reserves earning meager returns. The twostepsforward, onestepbackward recovery since September 21 hasnt created the enthusiasm that would necessitate an early, nasty correction. Investors, keeping in mind that every rally of the past 19 months has ultimately failed, are regaining their confidence only slowly. Background conditions dont lend themselves to a strong advance in the near term. While recent data suggest that the recession will be mild and will end early next year, risks to this forecast are high. Another terrorist attack could deepen consumer gloom. The possibility of the disruption of oil supplies still exists. The fiscal stimulus package continues to be bogged down in partisan bickering. Treasury bond yields, moreover, have turned sharply higher, spurred by the less dire economic reports and by chart breakouts. Yields have quickly retraced the SeptemberOctober decline. SP technical analyst Mark Arbeter is impressed by the recent stock market action and anticipates higher levels over the intermediate term, but he believes the easiest and quickest gains are behind. Arbeter sees a likely substantial amount of stock for sale when Nasdaq currently at 1898 moves into the 1920 to 2300 range and the SP 500 now at 1139 reaches 1170 to 1300. He expects it will take time to chew through this supply. History also suggests limited nearterm upside potential. Three months after the low points of the nine postwar bear markets, the SP 500 was up an average of 14.9. The index is already up 18 since the September 21 low. Six months after the nine postwar bear market lows, however, the 500 showed an average gain of 24.4 12 months after the lows, the index was ahead 34.5, on average.

"wrote Jim, I realize you are excited about these post offices. But I really need help analyzing the numbers. Phillip Original Message From James Wills ENRON Sent Wednesday, November 14, 2001 138 PM To Subject Re new PO available Phillip, Carlos and I will try to respond to your request for a spreadsheet in the next day or two Ill be at the home office in New Braunfels tomorrow. Meanwhile, I wanted to pass on some news...the Killeen post office probably is gone...I wrote a contract this morning thats now on its way to California for signature. Of course, if you wanted to submit one also, we can do it fairly quickly. Incidentally, I had the price wrong on Killeen...its 1,377,550, not 1,360,000. HOWEVER!! Heres info about another new listing that may be ideal for you its a brand new post office at CANYON LAKE, just north of SA, and in a really ideal location to serve all the small communities that surround the reservoir. I have attached a flyer for you...this one, like Killeen, will not be around long because there are other brokers promoting it. I have talked to the postmaster, who tells me that almost all the boxes are gone, and the building is just now ready for occupancy. CPS is connecting over 2200 new power boxes a month in the area. Its really growing. Let me know what you think!! With best regards, Jim Wills wrote Jim, I received your email on the Killeen post office. I am still having a tough time making the math work. Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment? Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect. Phillip Original Message From James Wills ENRON Sent Friday, November 09, 2001 422 PM To Subject new PO available Phillip, Hope your trip to Kerrville was worthwhile, and you had a chance to check out the Heritage Building. I am writing to tell you about another post office that has just come back on the market...its in Killeen, and was under contract for about 30 days. But one of my clients here who was in a 1031 exchange, and had designated three post offices with us, could only actually buy two, so today he released this one. The Killeen post office Harker Heights, a suburb is one of the best we have had in our inventory. It was built by a developer who is a friend of ours and has been constructing POs for many years. She had to turn down two other potential buyers recently because it was under contract. Im sure it will not last long. I have attached a flyer for you, and can supply a copy of the lease too. If you are interested, do let me know soon...we will need to act quickly!

substantially improve in a short period of time. THE TEXAS MBA TOUR All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA

Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business

Sortable Standings ? Gridiron Guru ? Tip of the Week IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Thanksgiving Football Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday Packers vs. Lions at 1230 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 405 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status active or reserve set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new adddrops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursdays first kickoff.

However, you can click the PF Points For column to display the top pointscoring teams at the top or the PA Points Against column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them. Gridiron Guru Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where well answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to . Youll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question Marcus Howell Who would you start in Week 11 Brian Griese at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego? Answer GG Grieses receiving corps has been crippled by injuries this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But remember that he was facing the 09 Lions, and Plummer has never been able to string many good performances together in the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post respectable numbers at Dallas. Question Eric Fernau Which three running backs should I start? I have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest Holmes and Garrison Hearst. Answer GG Dillon is a muststart player every week. Holmes is facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. Staley should have little trouble ripping through the Washington front wall. Its hard to ignore Hearst at Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game. Question Jay Rassat Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they play against are all decent N.O., N.E. and Seattle. Answer GG Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. Green will be facing a Seattle team that wont offer much of a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, well go with the New England QB. Tip of the Week Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT Ricky Watters decision to not have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Rickys a great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a back like Alexander.

"IMAGE Market Insight for November 26, 2001 From IMAGE The Global Online Financial Services Firm Introducing Goldman Sachs PrimeAccesssm Research As a TD Waterhouse customer, you now have online access to Goldman Sachs PrimeAccesssm Research. Just login at tdwaterhouse.com , click on News Research, and then on Goldman Sachs. We See Upswing Continuing By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook Selective accumulation remains in order. The early stages of recoveries from bear markets vary widely in degree. As time passes, however, deviations from the norm become far less dramatic. Through last Wednesday, when we went to press early because of the holiday, 31 of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to September 21, 2001 had been recaptured. Thats about average for rebounds in the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right of this weeks edition of The Outlook, at the twomonth point in the recoveries from the nine former bear markets since World War II, the SP 500 had won back an average of 33 of the bear market loss. In each of the nine instances, the gain at the end of six months was greater than that after two months and the gain at the end of 12 months was greater than that after six months. On average, nearly twothirds of the bear market loss was recovered after six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped in a year. Economic and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but thats typically the case in the early part of a bull market that is associated with an economic recession. Stock prices start recovering well before the headlines improve. The September upturn in stocks would be consistent with the start of an economic expansion in the first quarter of next year. While PE ratios currently are high, that wont necessarily keep the bull market from progressing. The preceding economic expansion was the longest in history and gave rise to new era optimism. Corporations, especially in information technology, built production and sales capacity to levels far greater than proved justified. Those excesses are now being corrected, painfully. Corporate earnings are in a severe contraction. Once the economy begins to grow again, however, profits will rebound and PEs will start looking much more reasonable. Low inflation, low interest rates, rapid technological innovation and aboveaverage productivity growth should help support elevated stock valuations.

"Here are the key points that came out of todays meeting 1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the
Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 510 problems of each type. 2. You will provide us with the names of people who can give us content
for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings one early next
week to gather content and a second meeting for review. 3. We will change Gas Daily Risk to IntraMonth Risk throughout the
simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of IntraMonth risk? 4. Just to clarify For conversion, we were planning to cover problems
where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to
hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil
volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too? Thank you in advance for your help. Have a great Thanksgiving.

"You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
or emails. We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back online. We have finalized the movement of your customer account s and relinked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID Acct . This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account s to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you our IBS clients might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may or may not want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please email or
phone the information to us and we will remove this information right
away. To our IBS Billpayer clients During this process, we seem to have misplaced blown away your bill
payment information particularly anyone that has had reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days. This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers reenter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
and support. Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we yourselves and
ourselves do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information 1 You have entered your password incorrectly or what you thought was
the correct password and been given the error message You have failed
to correctly login three times today please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 8303795236 to have your password reset. This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you
online on the phone or by email our preferred method. Should you
receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for
either myself Howard Gordon 8304011185, Christina Kirby 8304011189, or Lora Robles 8304011182. If you reach our voice mail

last six 6 digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six 6 digits of your ssn
this is the ssn or tin of the primary account holder, then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as Name

"Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",General Inquiry

"IMAGE Envoy GMCs Bold New SUV The GMC Envoy is one of the nicest surprises of the 2002 model year. It represents a comprehensive improvement over its Jimmy predecessor, making it one of the most competitive midsized SUVs on the market. The fact that it is still truckbased which essentially refers to the fullframe construction that makes its Yukon big brother such a beefy workhorse does not mean that this SUV rides like a truck. Quite the contrary, the Envoy is smooth and refined in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. Of course, the market in which the Envoy competes has become packed with excellent choices, with everyone from Acura to Mercury entering the fray.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter Subject Westgate ProformaPhillip Allen.xls Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40 per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street
widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of 680,000 and
an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an AD Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at 700,000 for a 50 interest in the
profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
5123381119 or 5123381110. My cell phone is 5127487495 and the fax is
5123381103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take
my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Diana Zuniga Subject Sagewood Town Homes I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the 180s, He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a he is selling them during construction and b they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 11641302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be 73.80 psf at 182,000. I thought his
sales price was 187,000. At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for 203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a the rental rate and b the
rentability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation. As for rentability, I believe that we have shown that the
3bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter Subject Westgate ProformaPhillip Allen.xls Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40 per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As
it is in the Smart Growth Corridor area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detentionretention and filtration pond and street
widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detentionretention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer

"George Richards on 09262000 011845 PM
Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Claudia L. Crocker Subject Investment Structure STRUCTURE
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or LLC
general partner. The General Partner owns 1 of the project and carries the
liability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investors do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits
is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS
The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as
high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at
2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000
which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required
of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
spec loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the
builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans
in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for
presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. REPORTING

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Claudia L. Crocker Subject Investment Structure STRUCTURE
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or LLC
general partner. The General Partner owns 1 of the project and carries the
liability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investors do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits
is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS
The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as
high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at
2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000
which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required
of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
spec loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the
builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans
in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for
presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS

Investors Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project? San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units. The land is selling for 2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly 1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12month lease and
1.301.40 psf if leased on a 12month term, but by individual room. This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity. The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be 300,000 to secure the land. I will
know more on this question later today. Sincerely, George W. Richards

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allans list the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like Excel. What needs to happen on Monday from 3 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture.

Please respond to To Phillip Allen cc Larry Lewter , Claudia L. Crocker Subject Investment Structure STRUCTURE
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or LLC
general partner. The General Partner owns 1 of the project and carries the
liability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans. If the investors do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investors share of profits
is reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for resale, are
full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
nonrecourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTS
The 4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70 of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase
price of 680,000 this would mean a land loan of 476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of 3,966, given a 10 annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25 of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the fiscals. This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be
for 90 of the cost with the remaining 10 released one year after
completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75 of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least 20,000 and potentially as
high as 25,000. This would produce a loan amount of 15,000 on 20,000
per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of 9,000, fiscals at
2,000 and the land cost at 8,000 , total improved lot cost is 19,000
which means 0 to 4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be 0184,000. Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average 31,000 per lot. Of this, probably
13,000 would be for improvements and 19,000 for the land cost. The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100 of the land. The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70 of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as 10,000 per lot for a loan value of 7,000 per lot. Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be 15,000 per lot. This would give
you a total loan of 992,000, total cost of 1,232,645 for equity required
of 241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative
spec loan that is taken out prior to any presales activity. Second, is
a construction loan for a presold unit, but the loan remains in the
builderdevelopers name. Third, is a presold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be presold units with loans
in the name of the builderdeveloper. We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70 to 75 of value and construction loans for
presold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will
be from 80 to 95 of value. DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15 of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting. BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses? Please expand. INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investors input on design and materials. As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating. CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped. PRESELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested. I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. Sincerely, George Richards

Please respond to To Phillip Allen , Larry Lewter cc Subject SM134 Proforma.xls Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser. Note that the
construction management fee CMF is stated at 12.5 rather than our
standard rate of 10. This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity. Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high. Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost 49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is 5455 with CMF. It appears that the cash equity will be 1,784,876. However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with 1.5MM. I hope to finish the proforma today. The rental rates that we project are
1250 for the 3 ADA units, 11501200 for the 2 bedroom and 1425 for the 3

The data I have received thus far are summarized in the following paragraphs. The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh. The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh. A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a lot of guesswork. However, they should be within the ballpark of reality. Don Badley",General Inquiry

covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. I find it almost impossible to put down as the writing flows easily interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders and good

End Table Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss Los Angeles, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices. According to Belton, Missouribased Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal. At the CaliforniaOregon Border, heavy load power fell
172.00 from yesterday to 430.00475.00. What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have, said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower. Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend. Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between 2021, down 3 from yesterday. Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall, said one Northwest power trader. At the NP15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
206.25 from yesterday to 325.00450.00. Light load energy fell
to 200.00350.00, falling 175.00 from yesterday. PSC of New Mexicos 498megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend. At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
325.00335.00 plunging 182.50 from yesterday. Robert Scalabrino PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas Philadelphia, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy Peak nextday
power prices declined at the western hub of the PennsylvaniaNew
JerseyMaryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of 12.75 a megawatthour, with trades
ranging from 62.0076.00. Lexington, Massachusettsbased Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrows high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from todays expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday. Most of the days activity took place in the early part of
the morning, said one PJMbased trader. By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up. Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices. Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of 1.25 per million
British thermal units to 8.608.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
2.44 per million Btu, as revised 610 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements. In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into highpriced hourly markets. Peak nextday power at the Zone A delivery point sold 6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of 70.33, amid trades in the
67.0075.00 range. Power at Zone J sold 7.50 higher at 90.00
92.00. Karyn Rispoli MidContinent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices Cincinnati, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy U.S. MidContinent
nextday peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnatibased Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped 23.19
to 67.90 a megawatthour, with trades ranging from 75.00 as the
market opened down to 59.00 after options expired. In MidAmerica Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicagobased Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold 21.37 lower
on average at 60.0075.00, while power in lower MAIN sold 18.17
lower at 65.00100.00. Belton, Missouribased Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively. Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gasfired
generation to meet increased weatherrelated demand. Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at 7.808.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at 7.658.15 per million Btu. The weathers moderating and gas is down, so youve got
people coming to their senses, one trader said. These are much
more realistic prices. Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 1822 was offered at 60.00, down from 90.00
yesterday. MidContinent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling 37.67 less in northern MAPP and 44.17 less in
southern MAPP at 75.00125.00. Whats happening is the people who dont have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice, one MAPP trader said. Then youve got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off, he said, and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the days high and low trade. Ken Fahnestock Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said. Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid50s Fahrenheit later this week. There was nothing going on in Florida today, said one
southern energy trader. Everything was going to markets in the
north. Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid70s a megawatthour. Prices into TVA started in the 80s and 90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out, said on Entergy power trader. Prices,
declined to 60 and less. The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of 23.95
to 70.25 amid trades in the 65.0080.00 range. Offpeak trades
were noted at 32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates. Southeast power traders said revised 610 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region. In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices. The cold weathers backing off, said one SPP utility
trader. It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today its about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold. Power sold in northern sections of SPP at 78100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to 88.00. Southern
SPP traded at 82.00, 2 more than yesterday. Brian Whary U.K. DayAhead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand London, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. The dayahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatthour. Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S. Dayahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.720.15
pounds a megawatthour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.918.05 pounds a
megawatthour, 40 pence below yesterdays last trade. First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said. January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.624.73 pounds a
megawatthour, falling 17 pence. First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.621.7 pounds a
megawatthour, 10 pence below its previous close. Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatthour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatthour. Open positions on many shortterm structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed. Nick Livingstone Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 Bloomberg Energy Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. Week 51 dealt between 145152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterdays closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50140.25 kroner a megawatthour. Supply from hydroproducers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing. Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating. Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said. The markets been waiting for this day for a long time, a
Stockholmbased trader said. For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasnt lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price. Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S. The dayahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling. Thursdays system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatthour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 1015 kroner by the start of next week. Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter
term contracts. Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75138.5 kroner a megawatthour,
1.9 kroner below yesterdays last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatthour. Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydroproducers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said. Vattenfalls Ringhals 1, an 835megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. Todays rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
todays news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. Nick Livingstone

everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
theyre dead, Arry would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth. According to my vaaaast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths,
this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no ones

"I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 7134638626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list 1. Examine LDCs incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDCs sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasnt maximized operationally. Specific questions should include 1. Why in March 00May 00 werent total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFOs on weekends that push away too much gas from Socals system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip",General Inquiry
Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th. I have fed exd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow. When will more money be required? Escrow for roads? Utility connections? Other rezoning costs? What about property taxes? The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it. Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing? I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal. So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can.

"We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA. In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself. The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas. He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared. Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governors ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees. His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level. He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at 3000MW. He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by 02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided. He seemed interested in 1 the buy down of significant demand, 2 the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3 getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4 setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases. As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming. Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants. The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. This was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.
State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand instate gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here.
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos Jeff, again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help. We made some progress today.",Course Registration

"As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. Traders do that all the time theyre looking forward, said William Burson, a trader. It makes the market for natural gas. But the markets response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Associations director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. Its a little frustrating that they dont take the time to understand what we are reporting, McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons and culprits is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the markets speculators for the rise in gas prices. Its my firm belief ... that todays gas prices are being manipulated, Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winters startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixedrate contracts and hedging a sort of price insurance that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. Were passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over, said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. Theres been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change, said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a 1,456 December bill for heating the church more than double the previous Decembers bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. Its the talk of the town here, he said. A year ago that wasnt a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above 2 per thousand cubic feet a level that producers say didnt make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting 4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at 5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But 10 gas was coming. Belownormal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. Its all about the weather, said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to 10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most pricevolatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders dont need to know much about gas or whatever commodity theyre trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than 7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly 10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Associations weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summers unusually high 4 to 5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when belownormal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest yearend storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the associations McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didnt share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if Decembers cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. I was getting worried, he said. Then suddenly the market turned when Januarys weather turned warmer. Wednesdays storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than 1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers costofgas charge earlier this month to 8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to 9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a levelpayment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about 25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energys gas purchasing practices. Consumers are taking all the risk, Micheel said. Its time to consider some changes.

All QFs but Calpine have agreed with the IEP proposal Under the proposal, PGE would retain 106 million of what, Im not sure I think they mean a refund to PGE from QFs who switched to PX pricing. The money would come from changing the basis for the QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December and maybe earlier. PGE will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get some assurances of payment. SCE has defaulted with its QFs PGE has not yet but big payments are due on 2201. For gasfired QFs Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PGEs purchases from such QFs.

"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing 1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80 of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 6535 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas 1. Fixed construction profit of 1.4 million. Builder doesnt benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. 5 equity for meeting time and costs in original plan 51sq ft, phase 1 complete in November 5 equity for under budget and ahead of schedule 5 equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 6040, but could be as favorable as 5545.

cc Subject Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG CPUC Audit Report on Edison Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on 01302001 1002 AM Daniel Douglass 01302001 0831 AM To , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , cc Subject CPUC Audit Report on Edison The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG audit report on Southern California Edison I. Cash Needs
Highlights
SCE,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations and other measures. Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE,s available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of 51.8 million to 1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default. Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and payable.
SCE,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE,s credit ratings on most of its rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess various price scenarios upon SCE,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a 460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital improvement component as follows in millions
Operating and maintenance costs 77
Capital Improvement Costs 383
Total 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, parttime and contract positions to be eliminated with approximately 75 of the total staff reduction coming from contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling 383 million are for the most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost savings of approximately 92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery TRA and TCBA Activity
Highlights
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the Transition Cost Balancing Account TCBA Account of 494.5 million. This includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of 500 million and accelerated revenues of 175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE,s Transition Account TRA of 4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit balance of 1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to D.0101018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets. Our comments are summarized as follows
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal,s impact on SCE,s balance sheet would initially be to shift costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of 2.7 billion and a positive cash flow from operations of 7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to its parent, Edison International, of approximately 4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its shareholders of 1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common stock of 2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
there is no Section VII VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately 400500 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999. In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50 to over 600 million. This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.

"The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a livingdining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage guestroom downstairs with a game room officeexercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I dont know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didnt have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.

cc Subject re book admin for PipeGas daily option book When we meet, I would like to address the following issues 1. I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have several people who have not left before 1030 this week. 2. It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on Thursday night at 830 bc she did not get deal tickets from the trading floor until after 500 p.m.
3. It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the pl and benchmark part of her book often times by 600, but that what keeps her here late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets. One suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book. This was also my understanding from Kyle Etter, who has left the company.

"I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8. There are several reasons that I wont commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8 amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer. If we cant come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list. Email or call me later today. Phillip",General Inquiry
"My target is to get 225 back out of the stage. Therefore, I could take a sales price of 740K and carry a second note of 210K. This would still only require 75K cash from the buyer. After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around 20K cash. You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at 740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email.

the transaction. 2. Second, without the forward or takeout our typical Loan to Cost LTC will
be in the range of 75 80. The proposed Loan to Value of 75 is within the
acceptable range for a typical MultiFamily deal. Given the above proforma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit

03062001 0314 PM To George Richards cc
Subject Sagewood Phase II George, Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the Sagewood
Phase II project. Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction. First, the proforma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. We adjusted
proforma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. Additionally, there are about 500
units coming online within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project. We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to 8,868,000. I have summarized our issues as follows 1. Proforma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows ProForma Banks Adjustment Unit Unit Rent RentBR Unit Rent RentBR 2 BR2.5 BA 1,150 575 950 475 3 BRUnit 1,530 510 1,250 417 2. Proforma expenses were increased to include a 350unit reserve for unit
turn over. 3. A market vacancy factor of 5 was applied to Potential Gross Income PGI. 4. Based on the Banks revised N.O.I. of 1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of 8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60 phantom interest rate. 5. The debt service will be approx. 874,000year. 6. Given the debt of 8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of 2,956,000, consisting of the following Land 1,121,670 Deferred profit Overhead 415,000 Cash Equity 1,419,268 Total 2,955,938 7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage of

Please respond to To cc Subject Behind the Stage Two FYI Western Price Survey Contacts CalISOs declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hourtohour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling Californias Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended. CalISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending

"I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time. It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal. One point that is unclear is they claim that the 15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied. I looked at the closing statements and I didnt see 15,000 applied against the purchase price. Can you help clear this up. Assuming we clear up the 15,000, we need to get the property released. Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.

Something that I forgot to ask you. Do you know if Hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks? Also let me know about the parking. The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code. The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem. They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms. Phillip,General Inquiry

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2 overhead, 3 ???, and 5 profit. Why is profit only 4? Why are the architect fees up to 200K. I thought they would be 80K. What is the 617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan? What is the status on the operating pro forma?

cc Subject SW Gas Janie, Thanks for the fax on SW Gas. We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio fixed, indexed, collars.... should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of their PGAs and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management do you have any preference on structure? Are there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Laird",General Inquiry
"Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs 1. Is the framing Lumber 2 yellow pine? Wouldnt fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents power or turbine? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didnt know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 12 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 AC units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up. I am going to call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas. Phillip

"I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221d loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows 5 onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2 overhead 4 profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate 219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to 10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently 165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of 94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and TransportationCorpEnron or 7138537060 with any questions.

cc Christopher F CalgerPDX, Michael McDonaldSF Subject Re SW Gas Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning. They were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal. However, they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings. We are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals. Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a nonprofit and costly function procurement and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product. As to your other question. We have yet to identify or pursue other candidates however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities. We met with 8 entities this week 7 Municipals and SWG as we implement our strategy in California. Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach? Otherwise, we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

cc Tim HeizenraderPDX, Tim BeldenHOU, Matt MotleyPDX, Michael M DriscollPDX, Chris MalloryPDX, Jeff RichterHOU, Robert BadeerHOU, Sean CrandallPDX, Mark FischerPDX, Bill Williams IIIPDX, Diana ScholtesHOU Subject CAISO demand reduction Phillip et al., I have been digging into the answer to your question re demand reduction in the West. Your intuition as to reductions seen so far e.g., March 2001 vs. March 2000 was absolutely correct. At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6. This translates into a reduction of about 1,5001,600 MWa for last month March 2001 as compared with the previous year. Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions as opposed to forced reductions via rolling blackouts. Other forecasters e.g., PIRA are estimating that another 1,2001,300 MWa making total yearonyear reduction 2,7002,800 will come off starting in June. This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. Given that the 6 decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10 relative to last year. This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,3003,500 MWa in JunAug. In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89 of total Calif load, or 3637 of WSCC U.S. summer load. I think it is reasonable to assume that the nonISO portion of Calif i.e., LADWP and IID will see similar reductions in demand. As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years if BPA gets its wish. This figure represents approx 4 of the nonCalif WSCC. Several mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production. I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Califs economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10 reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I think we could easily expect an additional 23 on top of the 4 already realized, or approx 1,0001,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the nonCalif WSCC for this summer. This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,5007,000 MWa when compared with last summer. I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available. Meantime, I hope this helps. Please feel free to call 5034648671 if you have any questions or need any further information.",Course Registration

cc Subject Re This mornings Commission meeting delayed Phil, I suspect that discussionsnegotiations are taking place behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms, if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers. Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export Californias problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and its a pretty strong anti price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. Hope this info helps. Ray Phillip K 04252001 0228 PM

Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double dip into the fund. Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor. However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the longterm power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. If not, the state may be in breach of contract. Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult. The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion. However, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession. Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all longterm contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB 8X and AB 31X. AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to 10 billion in bonds. This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support. AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts. However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X. Senator Bowens language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy. According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund. For instance, Tony Strickland has stated that only 12 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion should be issued. Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday. Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge Financing

For more details please contact me at 713 8539510 Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes 5 billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority. The 5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the same as the 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward. Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations. Without the details of the longterm power contracts the governor has negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support. No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power. Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. However, this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor. The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it. The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash. The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X bridge loan stating that the DWR would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount. In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities. If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy. SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",Course Registration

End Table Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid WeatherRelated Demand Los Angeles, May 14 Bloomberg Energy Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand. At the SP15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped 186.88 to a Bloomberg index of 205.00 a megawatt
hour, amid trades in the 175.00225.00 range. Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline, said one Southwest trader. According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight. At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of 220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the 210.00240.00 range. Traders said that Arizonas Public Service Co. 1,270megawatt
Palo Verde1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31. At the MidColumbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Fridays SundayMonday package to a
Bloomberg index of 205.40, with trades at 175.00225.00. According to Belton, Missouribased Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal. We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop, said one Northwest trader. At the NP15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell 189.39 to a Bloomberg index of 207.75, with trades at
175.00228.00. According the California Independent System Operator todays
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand Philadelphia, May 14 Bloomberg Energy An increase in
available generation coupled with less weatherrelated demand,
caused nextday power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said. According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively. In the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volumeweighted index of 35.97 per megawatt hour, down 5.48 from
Friday. Theres just no weather out there, said one PJMbased
trader. Theres no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, its going to be that way all week
long. Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday. Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow. Nextday prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities. The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk. Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped 4.50 to
58.50, while Zones G and A fell 3.25 and 5.50, respectively, to
51.25 and 40.00 indices. Karyn Rispoli WeatherRelated Demand Drives MidContinent Power Prices Up Cincinnati, May 14 Bloomberg Energy Dayahead peak
power prices rose today in the MidContinent U.S. as high
weatherrelated demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said. Its supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA Tennessee
Valley Authority area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there, one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
Dailies and the balance of week are both stronger because of
that. The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnatibased Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
3.52 to 31.17 a megawatthour, with trades ranging from 29.25
when the market opened up to 35.00 after options expired. Cinergy power for WednesdayFriday delivery sold at 39.00
and power for May 2125 was offered at 45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week. Nextday power in TVA sold 2.15 higher on average at
28.0037.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday. Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because theres enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices, an
ECAR trader said. In MidAmerica Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume. Peak Monday parcels sold 2.25 higher on average at the
Chicagobased Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at 29.5034.50,
and 5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from 32.0040.00. MidContinent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
abovenormal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lowerpriced eastern hubs. ForTuesday power sold 7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at 45.0050.00 and 6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at 45.0052.00. Lexington, Massachusettsbased Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrows high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska. Theres no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Amerens grid too, one MAPP trader said.
Its likely to cause problems all week, since its hot here and
down in SPP the Southwest Power Pool. Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up Atlanta, May 14 Bloomberg Energy U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said. Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusettsbased Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than todays projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday. Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high80s to low90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said. The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatthour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to 37.20.
Trades ranged from 26.5042.50. On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of 2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of 34.44 amid
trades in the 28.0037.00 range. In Texas, dayahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of 47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000. Theres just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have, said one Texasbased utility power trader.
Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 9395 degree
Fahrenheit days. This year so far, the highest weve seen is
85 degrees, so thats about 10 degrees below normal for us. On the Entergy Corp. grid, dayahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at 38.5042.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of 40.25, 1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused dayahead prices to trade late at
3536. Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing dayahead energy
at 37 from utilities in the VirginiaCarolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC. Southern dayahead power traded 2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of 37, amid trades in the 3539 range. In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at 47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as 48.75. BalanceofMay Entergy
power was bid at 48, though few offers were heard, traders
said. On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at 40, though the nearest offer was 45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at 41, though no new trades
were noted. Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids London, May 14 Bloomberg Energy Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said. Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatthour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatthour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatthour, 11 pence lower than
Friday. The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said. Shorterterm contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said. June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatthour. On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week. Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said. Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest Lysaker, Norway, May 14 Bloomberg Energy Longerterm
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydrosupply, traders said. Winter2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatthour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatthour.
Winter1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50
214.00 kroner a megawatthour. The market crash everyone was waiting for never came now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions, an Oslo
based trader said. Im surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing. Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a more
realistic expectation following recent overestimation of wet
outlooks. Tuesdays system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatthour at 185.70 kroner a megawatthour,
down 7.45 kroner from todays price. Still, traders said this was
a high spot price for this time of the year. Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatthour
with 140 megawatts exchanged. Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatthours
generation, up 368 percent from Fridays 1,169 gigawatthours. Alejandro Barbajosa

cc Subject Transport pl Phillip
Ive noticed one thing on your intramonth transport pl that looks strange to me. Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but Ill point it out and let you decide. Let me know if this is O.K. as is, so Ill know to ignore it in the future. Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and Ill take care of it.. On PGE NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 235,019. If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate plnot change your overall pl. Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal s, paths and pl impacts of each. 139195 From Kingsgate to Malin 182,030 139196 From Kingsgate to PGENTuscarora 4,024 139197 From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin 8,271 231321 From Kingsgate to Malin 38,705 153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield 1,988 Suggested fix Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDPMalin Citygate to GDPKingsgate. Clay Basin storagethis is really a FYI more than anything elseI see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activityone appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. Im not sure of the best way to handle this since we dont really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, heres the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. There may be an operational reason why this occurred that Im not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought Id bring it to your attention just in case theres something you want to do about it. The columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the pL associated with each. Deal 251327 159540 265229 106300 201756

"Hi, We recently faced the same questions concerning our cement floor finishing heres what we found. Oringinal Plan was for stamped and pigmented color added at the cement
plant with stained accents and highlighting to simulate a sautillo tile. Our
project is rather large 2900 sq ft SB house with 1800 sq ft porch surrounding it.
Lots of cement approx. 160 sq yds. After looking at the costs we changed our
minds rather quickly. Labor for Stamping Crew 2500.00 Davis Color Stain 4lbs per yd x 100 yds x 18 lb 7200.00 These are above and beyond the cost of the concrete. Actual Result Took a truck and trailer to Mexico and handpicked Sautillo
tiles for inside the house. Changed the color of the cement on the porch to 1lb
per yd mix color, added the overrun tiles we had left over as stringers in the
porch and accented with acid etched stain. Tiles and Transportation 3000.00 Labor, mastic and beer. tile setting did it myself 1400.00 Acid Stain for porch 350.00 Davis Pigment 15 x 40 yds 600.00 I can get you the info on the stain if you like, I ordered it from a
company the web, cant remember off hand who. I ordered a sample kit for 35.00 which
has 7 colors you can mix and match for the results you want. It was easy to work
with much like painting in water colors on a large scale. Hope this helps you out, Matt Kizziah",Payment & Fees

"To Phillip K AllenHOU
cc Subject Thoughts on Presentation It is a shame that the CAISO doesnt provide actual generation by unit. The WSCC data, which is dicey and we dont have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. For your purposes the CAISO may suffice. I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between scheduled and actual generation. You are pulling scheduled. If someone doesnt schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that. You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. While they dont split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the scheduled number. The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually underscheduling depending on price. I think the presentation looks good. It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished. Id like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gasgenerated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption. I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses. If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story. Lets talk.",General Inquiry
